/// The CAdapter class reads an XML specification, creates a set of devices
/// based on the specification, and encapsulates the specification details in
/// its member variables.  Derived classes can convert a buffer index into a
/// device signal through use of the member vectors of this class.

/// @limitations This class cannot be constructed as a base adapter cannot be
/// used on its own.  The adapter instances should derive from this class and
/// invoke its constructor in their initialization list.
