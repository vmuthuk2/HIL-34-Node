/// The CTableReadLock class provides a thread-safe interface to a device table
/// through encapsulation of the table and its associated mutex.  The mutex is
/// acquired during construction of the read lock and released when the object
/// is destroyed.  This class was intended to be used with boost::shared_ptr,
/// but can also be utilized as a scoped lock.
/// 
/// @limitations This class cannot be copied as its implementation does not use
/// a reference counter.  Without a reference counter, copies would result in
/// multiple attempts to acquire a mutex by the same thread (which is bad).
