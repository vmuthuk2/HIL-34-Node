/// The RTDS adapter waits for a byte stream of data from its client.  It uses
/// that data to update the command table, and then responds to that data with
/// the current values of the state table.  The endian of both the sent and the
/// received data is swapped to emulate Big Endian.
/// 
/// @limitations If the adapter does not receive the expected amount of bytes
/// from the client, it will be blocked until more data is sent or the client
/// closes the connection.
