///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// The CTableLock class provides an interface for a device table using a
/// template engine.  The engine stores the device table and implements the
/// mutex lock, while the CTableLock class provides a set of functions used to
/// manipulate the table.  Instances of TLock are to define an accessor for the
/// device table with the function name TLock::GetTable().  This function may
/// be constant if it does not allow the device table to be modified.  Whether
/// the CTableLock class is thread-safe depends on whether the TLock instance
/// implements a valid mutex lock.
/// 
/// @limitations It is possible for this class to generate a large number of
/// compiler errors due to misuse.  A template engine was used so that these
/// errors would be detected at compile time rather than run time.  The most
/// likely source of an error is in incorrect implementation of the TLock or
/// incorrect use of a TLock elsewhere in the code.  As an example, a reader
/// lock used to write data to a device table will generate a compiler error
/// that will be associated with the CTableLock class.  Do not, ever, modify
/// this class to correct such an error.  Also note that this class does not
/// use const member functions.  This is due to some TLock instances using a
/// const TLock::GetTable() function.  A solution to this problem is not yet
/// known, but it's something that should be fixed.
